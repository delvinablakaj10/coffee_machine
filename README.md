Coffee Machine Program

This Python project simulates a simple coffee machine. The program allows users to select different types of coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino) and processes the order by checking resources, handling payments, and dispensing the coffee. The program is structured with object-oriented principles, making it modular and easy to extend or modify.

Key Features:
  Coffee Selection: Users can choose from espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
  Resource Management: The machine checks if there are enough ingredients before making a drink.
  Payment Processing: The program calculates the total cost based on coins inserted by the user and checks if the payment is sufficient.
  Reporting: The current resources and profit can be reported at any time.
  Modular Design: The project is divided into multiple modules, making it easy to maintain and extend.
  This project is a great exercise in Python programming, focusing on object-oriented design, user input handling, and basic financial transactions.
